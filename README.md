# Welcome to the Neopets Mod!


## This is a mod for Dwarf Fortress.
This mod still isn't ready for a release but it's coming along! 54 of the 55 Neopet species now exist in the world, interacting with others, building skills, making art, assuming roles and being depicted as deities.

This is my little pet project honestly. I'm making it because I've always thought seeing Neopets in DF would be cool, and there's a lot of awesome stuff in Neopia to support the idea. Neopets was the first online game I'd ever played, way back when I was around 7-8 or so years old, and later introduced me to HTML and CSS. Needless to say, it holds a special place in my heart. So this project is being written because I'm trying to realize something I've always wanted to do with DF since I started playing back in 2012. I've been having fun putting tons of (strange) thought into this; it occupies a lot of my time, but honestly I couldn't be more proud.
